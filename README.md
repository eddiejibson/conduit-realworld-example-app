> **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://realworld.io/) spec and API.**

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

**[Demo app](https://conduit-realworld-example-app.fly.dev/)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[With Create React App](https://github.com/TonyMckes/conduit-realworld-example-app/tree/create-react-app)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Other RealWorld Example Apps](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=fullstack)**
